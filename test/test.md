Hello and welcome to the first post of this humble blog! A few months ago I did the Luas Dublin app. This app shows Luas lines and real-time information for each stop. What I would like to share with you today is a class that I used to draw Luas lines and stops. You can download a full example here. The TubeLine class extends of UIView class. This class draw parts of the line,  these parts could be the beginning of the line, the end, forks etc. You can see here different types:
You can configure if it's drawing in horizontal or vertical way, the colour of the line and the type of the part you are drawing.
The TubeLine class overwrite the draw method of the UIView class. The first thing that we have to do for drawing itâ€™s to create a context with the function UIGraphicsBeginImageContext. According to Apple class reference, UIGraphicsBeginImageContext Creates a bitmap-based graphics context and makes it the current context.
